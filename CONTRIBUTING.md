## Code of conduct
Let's not make too big a deal about this. Be friendly, use common sense and remember that we're all humans.

## Style guide
This project contains an `.editorconfig` file, which dictates several basic settings for your IDE. See [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/#download) to find a plugin for your IDE of choice.

### Code style
The library is written in Typescript. The code is linted by ESLint, so you can see the `.eslintrc.js` file for more information on the ruleset used. You can also look at the existing files and follow the same formatting.

If anything is unclear, try to follow the existing code style and keep things consistent.
